TOPIC : 
  Detect malicious activity to stop attacks using Machine Learning

IBM HACKATHON PROJECT
  We have used IBM Service : Auto AI to compare different ML algorithms and select ML algorithm which we should use to get more accurate result. We have built a model which will help users in detecting whether the .exe file which is downloaded is malicious or legitimate (safe).

IBM Services used :
  1. Watson Studio
  2. Auto AI

## Steps to follow :

  1. Download all the files and unzip the dataset file.
  2. Change the path according to location of dataset and run.
  3. Add the path of .exe file and check whether it's malicious or legitimate.
